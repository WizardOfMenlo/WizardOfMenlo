### Hi there üëã

Welcome to this GitHub account. I am Giacomo, a PhD student in cryptography @EPFL. 

I am mainly interested in probabilistic proof systems, and aim to achieve schemes that are both asymptotically and concretely efficient.

## Main projects
- Blendy üçπ: A space-efficient implementations of the prover in the sumcheck protocol. Code available at [space-efficient-sumcheck](https://github.com/compsec-epfl/space-efficient-sumcheck)
- Lattice-based polynomial commitment schemes, aiming to build the 'lattice-based KZG'. This line of work resulted in [2023/846](https://ia.cr/2023/846) and [2023/1469, SLAP üëã](https://ia.cr/2023/1469). For more info also see the [blog](https://gfenzi.io/lattices/towards-asymptotic-and-concrete-efficiency/) [posts](https://gfenzi.io/lattices/slap/).

## Other projects
- [Klondike](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/inst-infsec/appliedcrypto/education/theses/thesis%20(4).pdf). An analysis of classical collision finding algorithms when applied in a distributed setting, focusing on attacking isogeny based schemes.
- [Elliptic curves](https://youtu.be/HsqfumdYrUA). An entirely too short primer on elliptic curves and their role in pre and post-quantum crypto.
